# ToDo list

1. Setup hardware (temperature + gases).
2. Get them on client (w/ ESP32 support).
3. Diversify gas values from MQ2 (separate densities).
4. Setup MongoDB + Mongoose + MongoDBAtlas.
5. Send and fetch values from a database with showing data history.
6. Temperature should also show predictions (mean value?).
