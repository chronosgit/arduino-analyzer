## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- An ESP32 or similar microcontroller with connected sensors (e.g., MQ2 for gas detection, DHT11 for temperature and humidity).
- A stable Wi-Fi connection for the ESP device to communicate with the web application.
- Node.js and npm/yarn installed on your system.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chronosgit/esp-sensors-analyzer.git
   cd esp-sensors-analyzer
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Configure ESP Device and the environmental variables**
4. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## How It Works

- The ESP device collects temperature and gas data using connected sensors.

- Data is sent to the web application via an API or WebSocket.

- The application processes the data and visualizes it with dynamic charts and graphs.
